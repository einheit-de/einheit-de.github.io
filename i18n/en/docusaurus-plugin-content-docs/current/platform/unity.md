# Unity through Community

**Social cohesion instead of political division**

The current social situation in Europe in general and in Germany in particular, as well as the miserable failure of the traffic light coalition, call for unity within the opposition as well as the populace at large.

A crisis of such magnitude can only be overcome if all parts of politics and the wider population pull together.

When the health, safety and prosperity of the German people are at stake, political differences should not matter.

:::caution â€Ž
We seek to bring about a coalition between left and right workers' parties such as Germany's The Left and the AFD.<br/>
For the sake of the people and against prevailing dogma.
